# Milestone Project 2 - Visit Kingston


View live project [here]().

---
## Description

This is a fictitious site created as part of a full stack web development course with [code institue](codeinstitute.net).

This site was designed, created and built by myself to showcase taking a project from inception to functioning website. The website was built and designed with a mobile-first view point, with the aim of creating a well designed, easy to navigate website that is repsonive to all devices. The idea behind the site was to create an interactive and enticing page to provide information for those wanting to visit the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames in South London. The site currently features 3 pages; 'Home', 'About Kingston' and 'Contact Us'. The main information sections fall within the 'About Kingston' page, with 3 areas within; Food & Drink, Places To Stay and Attractions.  

To build the site I have put into practice the knowledge and skills acquired from the first five modules of the full stack course; namely HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, User Centric Frontend Development, JavaScript Fundamentals and Interactive Frontend Development.
