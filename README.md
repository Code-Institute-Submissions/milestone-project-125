## Description

This is a fictitious site created as part of a full stack web development course with [code institute](codeinstitute.net).

This site was designed, created and built by myself to showcase taking a project from inception to functioning website. The website was built and designed with a mobile-first view point, with the aim of creating a well designed, easy to navigate website that is repsonive to all devices. The idea behind the site was to create an interactive and enticing page to provide information for those wanting to visit the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames in South London. The site currently features 3 pages; 'Home', 'About Kingston' and 'Contact Us'. The main information sections fall within the 'About Kingston' page, with 3 areas within; Food & Drink, Places To Stay and Attractions.  

To build the site I have put into practice the knowledge and skills acquired from the first five modules of the full stack course; namely HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, User Centric Frontend Development, JavaScript Fundamentals and Interactive Frontend Development.

### Design

---

#### Colour Scheme

The two main colours across the site are white and dark blue. The specific dark blue was chosen to match the dark blue within the Royal Borough of Kingston coat of arms. The specific coat of arms for Kingston can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Thames_London_Borough_Council#/media/File:Kingston_upon_Thames.svg).

I picked the colour scheme to compliment the coat of arms and provide a simple and easy on the eye UX whilst also allowing me to differentiate pages with either a white or dark blue background.

The hex codes for the two main colours are #FFFFFF and #03487E.

#### Fonts

The main font used on the site is Noto Serif. It was chosen after experimenting with a number of fonts on [google fonts](fonts.google.com); it provided a visually pleasing font which stood out against both the dark blue and white backgrounds.

#### Landing Imagery

The imagery chosen for the landing screen was used to highlight multiple positive aspects kington has to offer and to entice the user to dig deeper into what they can do when visiting kingston.
